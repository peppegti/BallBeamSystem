# Ball and Beam System Repository  

The **Ball and Beam system** is a classic educational tool in control systems engineering. It is widely used to demonstrate the challenges of stabilizing an unstable, nonlinear dynamic system. The setup consists of a beam pivoting around a hinge, allowing a ball to roll along its length. The control objective is to regulate the ball's position on the beam by adjusting its tilt angle.

This system is inherently unstable‚Äîany slight tilt causes the ball to roll away from its desired position, accelerated by gravity. The further the beam tilts, the faster the ball moves, making stabilization increasingly difficult. To counteract this instability, a feedback control strategy is employed. In this project, a **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller** is implemented to maintain the ball's position by continuously adjusting the beam angle based on real-time feedback from a distance sensor.

## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized into the following directories:  

### 1. **Arduino/**  
This folder contains the Arduino code that is responsible for implementing the PID controller. The code reads real-time feedback from the Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor and adjusts the angle of the beam via a servo motor to stabilize the ball.  


### 2. **Matlab/**  
This folder includes a MATLAB script for plotting the system's **Bode diagram**. The script helps analyze the system's frequency response and evaluate the stability and performance of the PID controller.  


### 3. **STL/**  
This folder contains all the 3D printable **STL files** required to build the physical components of the Ball and Beam system, including the beam, supports, and sensor mounts.
Each file in the STL folder requires one piece to be printed, except for the file clip, which requires two pieces.
